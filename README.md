# E-commerce API with Java Spark

This project is a RESTful API for a basic e-commerce system, developed using the *Java Spark* micro-framework. The API supports customer management, product catalog viewing, and shopping cart administration. Authentication is handled via JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

## Key Features

-   *Customer Management:* User registration and login.
-   *Security:* Passwords hashed with jBCrypt and protected routes using JWT authentication.
-   *Product Catalog:* Endpoints to list and view product details.
-   *Shopping Cart:* Full CRUD functionality for an authenticated user's shopping cart.
-   *Layered Architecture:* Organized structure into Controllers, Repositories, and Models for better maintainability.
-   *Database Integration:* Connects to a MySQL database.
-   *Exception Handling:* Standardized error responses for 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error, and 401 Unauthorized.

## Sprint 2 Deliverables

This section documents the requirements met during Sprint 2, focusing on the backend implementation.

### 1. Exception Handling Module

A robust exception handling system has been implemented to ensure the API responds predictably to different error scenarios.

-   *ErrorResponse Class:* A standardized DTO (util/ErrorResponse.java) was created to format all error messages into a consistent JSON structure ({ "errorCode": "...", "message": "..." }).
-   *Supported Cases:*
    -   *404 Not Found:* Triggered when a client requests a specific resource by an ID that does not exist in the database. The controllers handle empty Optional results from the repository to return a clear 404 response.
    -   *500 Internal Server Error:* A global try-catch (Exception e) block in each endpoint acts as a safety net. It captures any unexpected server-side errors (e.g., database connection failures, SQL syntax errors), preventing the application from crashing and returning a generic but safe 500 error message.
    -   *401 Unauthorized:* Implemented for protected routes (/api/carrito/*). An authentication method validates the JWT on each request. If the token is missing, invalid, or expired, the request is halted, and a 401 error is returned.

### 2. Source Code Implementation

The backend source code for the main business logic was developed, including:

-   *Authentication Logic (ClienteController, Auth.java):* Implemented user registration and login endpoints. The system generates a JWT upon successful login.
-   *Product Catalog API (ProductoController, ProductoRepository):* Created endpoints to fetch all products and a single product by its ID from the database.
-   *Shopping Cart API (CarritoController, CarritoRepository):* Developed the full CRUD functionality for the shopping cart, with each endpoint protected by JWT authentication to ensure data privacy.

### 3. Integration and Logic Error Resolution

During development and testing with Postman, several integration and logic errors were identified and resolved:

-   *Database Schema Mismatch:* Corrected the password column length in the cliente table from VARCHAR(50) to VARCHAR(60) to accommodate the length of a BCrypt hash.
-   *Authentication Flow (NullPointerException):* Debugged and resolved a NullPointerException in the CarritoController caused by an issue in the JWT validation filter. The authentication logic was refactored to ensure the user ID was correctly retrieved from the token and passed to the business logic.
-   *API Contract Mismatch (Foreign Key Constraint Fails):* Fixed a 500 Server Error caused by a foreign key violation when adding items to the cart. The error was traced to a mismatch between the JSON key expected by the API (idProducto) and the key being sent (id). The documentation and Postman examples were updated to reflect the correct API contract.

## Development Environment Setup

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   JDK 17 or higher installed.
-   Apache Maven installed.
-   A running MySQL database server.
-   An API client like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

### 1. Database Configuration

First, you need to create the database and tables.

sql
-- Create the database
CREATE DATABASE ecommerce;

-- Use the database
USE ecommerce;

-- Create the required tables (full script)
CREATE TABLE cliente (
id INT AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL,
nombre VARCHAR(40),
password VARCHAR(60), -- IMPORTANT: Sized to 60 for BCrypt
numero VARCHAR(20),
CONSTRAINT PRIMARY KEY(id)
);

CREATE TABLE descripcion(
id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
descripcion VARCHAR(200),
CONSTRAINT PRIMARY KEY(id)
);

CREATE TABLE producto(
id INT AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL,
nombre VARCHAR(60),
prec FLOAT(10,2),
foto VARCHAR(100),
cantidad INT,
id_descr INT,
CONSTRAINT FOREIGN KEY(id_descr) REFERENCES descripcion(id),
CONSTRAINT PRIMARY KEY(id)
);

CREATE TABLE carrito (
id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
id_cli INT,
id_pro INT,
cantidad INT,
CONSTRAINT PRIMARY KEY(id),
CONSTRAINT FOREIGN KEY(id_cli) REFERENCES cliente(id),
CONSTRAINT FOREIGN KEY(id_pro) REFERENCES producto(id)
);

-- (The 'venta' and 'detalle_venta' tables would go here)


### 2. Populate the Database with Products

Run the following script to add initial products to the catalog.

sql
-- Inserts for 'descripcion' table (product descriptions)
INSERT INTO descripcion (id, descripcion) VALUES
(1, 'A cap autographed by the famous Peso Pluma.'),
(2, 'A helmet autographed by the famous singer Rosalía, a true MOTOMAMI!'),
(3, 'A jacket of Bad Bunny''s favorite brand, autographed by the artist himself.'),
(4, 'A high-quality acoustic guitar used by the famous singer-songwriter Fernando Delgadillo.'),
(5, 'A jersey signed by the legendary rapper Snoop Dogg.'),
(6, 'A crop-top worn and autographed by the famous rapper Cardi B. on her last visit to Mexico'),
(7, 'An electric guitar autographed by the popular British band Coldplay, a day before their concert in Monterrey in 2022.');

-- Inserts for 'producto' table
INSERT INTO producto (nombre, prec, foto, cantidad, id_descr) VALUES
('Gorra autografiada por Peso Pluma', 621.34, 'gorra_pp.jpg', 10, 1),
('Casco autografiado por Rosalía', 734.57, 'casco_rosalia.jpg', 5, 2),
('Chamarra de Bad Bunny', 521.89, 'chamarra_bb.jpg', 8, 3),
('Guitarra de Fernando Delgadillo', 823.12, 'guitarra_fd.jpg', 3, 4),
('Jersey firmado por Snoop Dogg', 355.67, 'jersey_snoop.jpg', 15, 5),
('Prenda de Cardi B autografiada', 674.23, 'prenda_cardib.jpg', 7, 6),
('Guitarra autografiada por Coldplay', 458.91, 'guitarra_coldplay.jpg', 4, 7);


### 3. Configure Database Credentials

Open the file src/main/java/mprower/javaspark/config/Database.java and adjust the connection credentials to match your local setup.

java
package mprower.javaspark.config;

// ... imports

public class Database {
// Replace with your credentials
private static final String URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/ecommerce";
private static final String USER = "root";
private static final String PASSWORD = "YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE"; // <-- CHANGE THIS

    // ... rest of the code ...
}


### 4. Compile and Run the Project

Open a terminal at the project root and run the following Maven commands:

bash
# Clean the project and build the JAR file
mvn clean package

# Run the application
java -jar target/YOUR-JAR-FILE-NAME.jar


Alternatively, you can run the main method in App.java directly from your IDE. If everything is set up correctly, you will see a message in the console indicating that the server has started on http://localhost:8080.
